# Bike Sharing 
Bike sharing data analysis using Tableau to visualize the data
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the breakdown of information provided by the New York Citibike data in order to implement a bike sharing program in Des Moines. In order to complete this visualization, I used jupyter notebook to first convert the tripduration from an integer datatype into datetime datatype. The next step was to take the new data and implement it into a new storyboard using Tableau.
## Results 
For this repository, I used [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bike_Sharing_16633796743960/BikeSharing?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
## Summary
In summary, with the help of Tableau understanding the Citibike data is more comprehensible. While there are some who are able get the whole picture based on numbers. Others need different ways to visualize the same data. Another great aspect of using Tableau, would be that it also allows the data to be filtered into multiple different visualizations. One additional visualization that would be beneficial to this dataset would be to find out where did the riders start based on their gender.  Does one gender predominately start their bike trip in a different place then the others? A second visualization that could be added would be does age factor into the starting and ending locations.
